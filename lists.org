* Lists
  Org supports a number of different types of lists.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    - Minus sign is an unordered list
    - More stuff
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Minus sign is your basic unordered list.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    + Plus sign is another type of list
    + More stuff 
    #+END_EXAMPLE 

    Plus sign mixes it up with another type of list.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    1. Numbered lists are valid as well
    2. More stuff 
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Numbered lists are also supported, but minimally. In true org mode lettered and numbered lists work.
    I do not have full support for switching from numbers to letters at this time.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    - Item :: Definition   
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Definition lists are an orgmode thing. We can highlight them but do not have any powerful commands for this at the moment.

** Checkboxes

	Checkboxes are also a sort of a mini todo item.
	They are very handy!

** Numbered Lists
  Numbered lists are always a pain to author. The list tools can use the standard recal command
  to reorder a list for you automatically.

  In addition adding to a numbered list is supported by the OrgAppendNumberedList command.

** Sorting Lists
   
   Not nearly as powerful as emacs org mode sorting. 
   The contents of lists can be sorted alphabetically by putting your cursor over an element in the list and then running

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Org Sort List
   #+END_EXAMPLE
